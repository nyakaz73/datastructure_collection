# Python datastructure_collection
A DataStructure collection written in Python which helps developers and big-data scientists in implementing fast and efficient algorithms.

### Show some :heart: and :star: to the repo to support the project

## Package
The Pypi [datastructer_collection](https://github.com/nyakaz73/datastructure_collection.git) package can be found [here](https://github.com/nyakaz73/datastructure_collection.git)

## Getting Started
The datastructure_collection has three data structure classes :

* 1. [BinarySearchTree](https://github.com/nyakaz73/datastructure_collection.git)

* 2. [HashMap](https://github.com/nyakaz73/datastructure_collection.git)

* 3. [LinkedList](https://github.com/nyakaz73/datastructure_collection.git)

I Look forward to add more datastructures in the future.

## Installation

Run the following to install package :

```bash
pip install datastructure_collection
```
## Usage

[Example](https://github.com/nyakaz73/datastructure_collection/blob/master/tests/datastructure_example.py)

To use this package :

```python
from datastructure_collection import BinarySearchTree

from datastructure_collection import HashMap

from datastructure_collection import LinkedList
```

## Binary Search Tree
The Binary Search Tree operations and the time complexities are shown in the table below:

| Operation                 | Best Case     |  Worst Case   |  
| -------------             |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| tree = BinarySearchTree() | O(1)          | O(1)          |
|                           |               |               |
| tree.add(key, value)      | O(logN)       | O(N)          | 
| tree.remove(key)          | O(logN)       | O(N)          |
| tree.valueOf(key)         | O(logN)       | O(N)          |
| tree.isEmpty()            | O(1)          | O(1)          |
| tree.minValue()           | O(logN)       | O(N)          |
| tree.maxValue()           | O(logN)       | O(N)          |
| n = len(tree)             | O(1)          | O(1)          |
| x in tree                 | O(logN)       | O(N)          |
| traversal                 | O(N)          | O(N)          |

As seen from the table above the Binary Search Tree has an advantage over a Linear List in terms of its searching mechanism the tree will be to somewhat sorted where the left elements of a node are less that the elements of a right node, thus giving it a Best case runtime of O(logN) as compared to a List search of O(N).
The Worst Case of a Binary Search Tree O(N) occurs when the elements of the tree are ordered linearly ie (elements are inserted with increasing order)
* **NB** The add,remove,minValue,maxValue and __contains__ ie "in", valueOf operators uses the search mechanism to locate the target.

The Worst Case of a BinarySearchTree can however be improved by implementing a **Balanced Search Tree** with datastructures like **(AVL trees, splay trees, and red-black trees)**  which i however shall add in the future.

### Example BinarySearchTree
```python

#import the BinarySearchTree Class
from datastructure_collection import BinarySearchTree

#Instantiate BinarySearchTree object
tree = BinarySearchTree()

tree.add(1,"Orange")
tree.add(4,"Banana")
tree.add(7,"Apple")
tree.add(2,"Tomato")


for i in tree:
    print(i) #Prints the sorted List of tuples contaiing the key, value pairs

tree.remove(4) #this removes the Banana node from the tree
print(len(tree)) #this returns a length of 3 since the Banana node was removed

```
## Hash Map
The [HashMap]() is the most commonly used data structure in solving  big data and maping problems. In most datastructure collection ,searching is the most important operation, and as such we need to do it fast and efficiently. Unilike most datastructures like Lists, Trees which are based on on key comparison when searching for a target, the [Hashmap]() uses a concept of **hashing** the keys upon searching which run in constant time O(1) to locate an index of a specific key.
I have used the concept of **double hashing** in implemnenting the hashing algorithm and **closed hashing/open addressing** for **Probing** . The hashing algorithm is as follows:
```python
'''
    def _double_hashing(self,k):
        double hashing reduces clusters primary and secondary thus reducing collisions
        Find the next slot by probing
        slot = (position + i ) % M  whrere i = 1,2,3 .. M-1 ; position = index position index to which the key was originally mapped by the hash
        function DOUBLE HASHING IS AS FOLLOWS:
        slot = (position + i ∗ hp(key)) % M
        hp(key) = 1 + key % P         P = constant  < M
        pass
    '''

```
Double hashing reduces primary and secondary clusture thus reducing collisions.

The table below shows the operations and time complexities of a [HashMap]()

| Operation                | Best Case     |  Worst Case   |  
| -------------            |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| map = HashMap()          | O(1)          | O(1)          |
|                          |               |               |
| map.add(key, value)      | O(1)          | O(N)          | 
| map.remove(key)          | O(1)          | O(N)          |
| map[key] = value         | O(1)          | O(N)          |
| map.get(key)             | O(1)          | O(N)          |
| map.isEmpty()            | O(1)          | O(1)          |
| n = len(map)             | O(1)          | O(1)          |
| x in map                 | O(1)          | O(N)          |
| traversal                | O(N)          | O(N)          |

As noted from the table above a [HashMap]() one one of the strongest data structure in implementing a map, as the fundamental core oprations ie **__getitem__**,
**__setitem__**,**__deltitem__**, runs at constant time at Best Case. The Hash Map worst case run-time can always be enhanced by implementing **SortedTableMap** which improves the Worst Case O(N) to O(logN), which i hope to add the datastructure in the future.


### Example HashMap
```python
hash = HashMap()

    hash.add('man',34)
    hash.add('person',23)
    hash.add('women',674)
    hash.add('camera',5)
    hash.add('tv',89)

    for i in hash:
        print('{}: {}'.format(i.key,i.value)) #prints the key value paris
    
    print(len(hash)) #returns length 5

    print(hash.remove('tv'))
    print(hash.remove('women'))
    print(hash.remove('man'))
    hash['women'] = 566

    for i in hash:
        print('{}: {}'.format(i.key,i.value))
    print(len(hash)) #returns lenth 3 
    print(hash.get('women')) # returns 566

```

## Linked List
One might ask why implement a  linked List datastructure if we already have a list in Python. Insertions and Deletions operation in a List requires items to be shifted to make a room or close the gap. This howver can be time consuming especially for large data. The add operator in a Linked List requires O(1) time where as the Pyhton List requires O(N)

The table below shows the operations and time complexities of a [LinkedList]()
| Operation                | Pyhton List   |  Linked List  |  
| -------------            |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| linked = LinkedList()    | O(1)          | O(1)          |
|                          |               |               |
| linked.add(value)        | N/A           | O(1)          |
| linked.append(value)     | O(N)          | O(N)          |  
| linked.remove(value)     | O(1)          | O(N)          |
| linked.isEmpty()         | O(1)          | O(1)          |
| n = len(map)             | O(1)          | O(1)          |
| x in linked              | O(N)          | O(N)          |
| traversal                | O(N)          | O(N)          |

### Example Linked List

```python
linked  = LinkedList()

for _ in range(10):
    linked.add(_)
linked.add(5)
linked.remove(5)
linked.append(55)
linked.append(56)
linked.append(7)
linked.add(59)
linked.append(79)
print('List Length: ',len(linked))
linked.remove(0)
print(linked)
print('List Length: ',len(linked))

for i in linked:
    print(i) #Prints the values in the Linked List

print(77 in linked) #Returns False 77 is not in Linked

```
